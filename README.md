# Unity Random Path Algorithm

## What is this?
This is an algorithm written in C# and the Unity game engine. It can be used to create a random path on a 2D grid system. If you for whatever reason need something like this, feel free to use it, and create a pull request if you want to suggest a change.

## How to use?
I've uploaded the whole Unity project, so you can just download, and add it to Unity Hub.
